# Game in QT

For the first game I wanted to program something simple, 
the meaning of the game itself is a battle with the boss(third person game). 
For the game, the engine and character animation was programmed by me. 
The game at this stage is not ready until the end.

All methods are available at include.

The builds folder contains all the models, animations and textures necessary in the project.
